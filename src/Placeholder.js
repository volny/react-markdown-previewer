Markdown is a lightweight markup language first proposed by [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/).

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable

> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.`
